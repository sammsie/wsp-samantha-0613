	<b>Project Summary:</b>
	<p>The intent of this project is to recreate a more visual pleasing website.  Fatwreck.com is already organized very neatly.  
	Links to other sections of the website are located in birds eye view.  You wouldn't get frustrated trying to find anything 
	because of the way it is organized.</p>
   
    <p>The main issue is just the design.  It's a nice site, but you can tell it's not using HTML5 or the best usage of CSS.  
    While validating the html I found 19 errors, and 1 warning.  That's quite a lot of errors!  For the most part the errors 
    were simply forgetting to use closing tags, and typos.  The CSS only had 5 errors, but once again I feel that I could create 
    a better design scheme with using CSS to full capacity.
    </p>
    
	<p>I'd like to set fatwreck.com apart from the other punk music communities with a visual much more pleasing website.

	<b>Audience Profile:</b>
	
	<p>This site is most popular with the male audience aged between 25-34. They have some college education, no children, 
	generally browse from home, make around $30K-$60K, and predominantly Caucasian.

	<b>Perception:</b>
	
	<p>I'm hoping with the redesign fatwreck.com will get more viewers. I want to take the punk look they already have and 
	"amp it up" so to speak.  I think their longtime viewers might enjoy it.
