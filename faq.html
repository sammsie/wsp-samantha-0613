	<h1>FAQ's</h1>
	
	<h2>I’ve heard there’s some REALLY beautiful women and men that work at Fat Wreck Chords. How do I contact the label?</h2>

	<p>Make donations to the Beer Fund.<br />

	For general inquiries, email <a href="mailto:mailbag@fatwreck.com">mailbag@fatwreck.com</a><br />

	For webstore inquiries, email <a href="mailto:mailorder@fatwreck.com">mailorder@fatwreck.com</a> and include your full name and order number from your confirmation email.<br />

	Aside from that, you can typically find us at any one of the bars or pubs in the San Francisco Bay Area. 
	With the obvious exception of Hemlock Tavern, Zeitgeist, Moby Dick’s, Kezar Pub, Mad Dog In The Fog, 
	Yancy’s, and Lucky 13. Duh.</p>	
	
	<h2>Do you guys take demos? How does our band get on Fat?</h2>

	<p>Oh we get demos. Shitloads of them. Mike thinks it would be lame not to accept demos, but then again, he doesn’t have 
	to listen to the fuckin’ things. If you must send us a demo, here is some advice: work on your songs, practice, and 
	play shows. It takes years of hard work to be a band that people care about, and once you’re there, labels will know about you. 
	Another thing, talent is not a requirement for Fat bands, but partying skills are.</p>

	<p>So yes, we accept demos. Send them all here:</p>

	<p>Asian Man Records ATTN: Mike<br />
	PO Box 35585<br />
	Monte Soreno, CA 95030</p>
	
	<h2>Who owns Fat Wreck Chords? I hear that it’s a diabolical cabal that is headed up by Mr. Brett, Lee Iacocca, and Charro?</h2>
	
	<p>Oooh, Charro. That would be nice. Fat Wreck Chords is an independently owned and operated record label founded by 
	Fat Mike and his wife Erin. They still own it and they both still run the place.</p>

	<p>Punk rock used to be about haggard road warriors. Before all the breakdowns and flat irons, 
	there were busted transmissions and collect calls home. The Flatliners grew up believing in 
	the later and rejecting the former, and after seven years playing together, they’re unleashing Cavalcade, 
	their third full-length record and an epic sonic testament to the life they’ve chosen.</p>
